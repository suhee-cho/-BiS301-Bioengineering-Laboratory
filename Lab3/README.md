Neural signal analysis - Neural spikes
-------------------------
**MATLAB Code**
- Attenuates the noise of the data by using butterworth highpass filter and setting signal amplitude threshold
- Plots filtered neural signal evoked by various intensities of stimuli and conducts statistical analysis
- Draws spike train raster plot
- Plots spike rate histogram with various bin sizes
- Calculates interspike interval and plots histogram of it with various bin sizes
- Plots stimuli strength-neural response curve
